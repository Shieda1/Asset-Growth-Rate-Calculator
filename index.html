    What is the asset growth rate?<br>
    The asset growth rate is a measurement of the period of time that the company has been growing it's assets. Simply it is the change in assets over a specific period of time and it is expressed as a percentage
    How to calculate asset growth rate?<br>
    To calculate asset growth rate you should use the following formula:<br>
    asset growth rate = (later price point - early price point) / early price point<br>
    example: company x's stock was priced at $112 per share 6 years ago and now the stock's price is $140, calculate the asset growth rate?<br>
    Using the asset growth rate formula the answer will be:<br>
    asset growth rate = (later price point - early price point) / early price point<br>
    asset growth rate = ($140 - $112) / $112<br>
    asset growth rate = 25%<br>
    Why use asset growth rate?<br>
    The asset growth rate is used to predict the future stock returns after taking into account the book to market ratio, momentum and the company's size.<br>
